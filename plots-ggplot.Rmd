# Plots with ggplot2

We are going to make plots in R using the ggplot2 package from the tidyverse. 

We will install these packages:

- tidyberse
- readxl: to read in excel files (in many ways)
- here: to help with filepaths

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # install.packages("tidyverse")
library(readxl) # install.packages("readxl")
library(here) # install.packages("here")
```

# California National Parks Data

```{r read-data}

ca_np <- read.csv(here("data/ca_np.csv"))
# can also be written (in this case but good practice to include the 'here' package that knows the full file path:
# ca_np <- read_csv(here("data", "ca_nps.csv"))
# also be written:
# ca_np <- read_csv("data/ca_nps.csv")
```
